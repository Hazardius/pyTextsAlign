In close proximity there did dwell two polities:
In ant-hills, industrious ants; and in beehives, bees.
And since good-neighbors' relations do not dampen pride,
There were frequent disputes: which were better organized?
Came autumn, and frightful times for the bees and their homes:
The diligent bee-keeper cut up the honeycombs,
Drove out the inhabitants, and cleared out their pantries:
All vain had been the harvesting efforts of the bees.
And the ants, seeing the sad end to the bees' harvest,
Said: "Sufficiency, rather than plenitude, is best."
